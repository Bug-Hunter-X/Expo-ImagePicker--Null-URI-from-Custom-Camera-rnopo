This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with a custom camera.  The issue is that after selecting an image from the custom camera, the image uri returned by the ImagePicker is null or undefined, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is particularly problematic when the custom camera functionality relies on asynchronous operations, making it harder to track down the source of the null or undefined value.
